# Welcome to CSSence Extension

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the location of the snippet file and specifies the language of the snippets.
* `snippets/snippets.json` - the file containing all snippets.

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Create a new file with a file type associated with your snippets (e.g., `.css` or `.scss`).
* Try out your snippets by typing a snippet prefix (e.g., `base-html`, `root-full`) and pressing `Tab` or `Enter`.

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Install your extension

* To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
* To share your extension with the world, read on <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs> about publishing an extension.

## Snippet Examples

Try out the following snippets:

1. Base HTML/Body Setup:

```scss
base-html⇥
```

2. Root Variables Setup:

```scss
root-full⇥
```

## Working with Markdown

Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+` on macOS or `Ctrl+` on Windows and Linux).
* Toggle preview (`Shift+Cmd+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux).
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux, macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets.
